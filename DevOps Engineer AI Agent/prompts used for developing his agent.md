**YOU ARE GOING TO DEVELOP THE BEST REPLACEMENT OF DevOps / Cloud Engineer  IN SDLC.**
IS IT POSSIBLE. ARE YOU READY.  JUST TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO DO I WILL ACT AS YOUR HANDS TO PERFORM DIRECT DEVELOPEMENT ACTIONS. WE HAVE PC(ULTRA 9 CPU, RTX 5060 TI) , GOOGLE CLOUD ACCOUNT, IDE(ANTIGRAVITY), LOT OF AI KNOWLEDGE .




**you understand my  idea well .we are just building a agent or agentic workflow . and our products can connect with tools used by human DevOps / Cloud Engineer  through  API s or  MCP(model context protocol)s.****
it also contain futures like coworking mode where is works with human partner and product must contain features like override and intercept. it must be best controllable product.
also imagine we have a user Ui interface also to handle our product. it may web or desktop application. also remember net  we are going to create other agents like product manager , solution architect or designer,software developer,  testing engineer agent whitch are in SDLC. all are working together in a single platform for user to boost his productivity.
so our solution and product design architect agent is a second agent we are developing. all other agents work is parallelly going. we will connect them all finally as final product like an autonomous platform.
ok i recommend this technology stake

**THE TECHNOLOGY STACK**
Component	Technology	Reasoning
Backend Framework	FastAPI (Python 3.11+)	Native async support (crucial for concurrent agents), auto-docs, enterprise standard.
Agent Orchestration	LangGraph	Best-in-class for Cyclic graphs, Persistence (Memory), and Human-in-the-Loop (Interrupts).
LLM Interface	LangChain	Standard abstraction layer for models and prompts.
Reasoning Model	Gemini 1.5 Pro (Vertex AI)	Massive context window (1M+ tokens) allows it to read entire codebases or long documentation.
Embedding/Memory	ChromaDB + HuggingFace	Runs locally on your RTX 5060. Zero cost, high privacy.
Database (App)	SQLite (Async)	Simple file-based DB for project metadata. Easy to backup/transfer.
Frontend	HTML5 / CSS3 / ES6 JS	No build step (React/Vue) required for V1. Direct control over the DOM.
Real-time Comms	WebSockets	Essential for streaming the Agent's "thinking process" to the UI instantly.
Tooling Protocol	MCP (Model Context Protocol)
tools used by DevOps / Cloud  Engineer need to do proper research and find which have apis or MCPs (model contect protocol).

**also don't generate codes we need to design product first like what our product do what are the tools and integration we are going to add. who the architecture like things . don\t rush be step by step accurate product.**
