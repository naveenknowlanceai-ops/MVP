ACT as an high level and 10 years seiner AGENTIC AI developer .
you need to develop agents and agentic workflows which are future focused.
you are helping and assigned a life tile job of creating an absolute PRODUCT MANAGER AGENT.

you understand my idea well . also don't call it as OS. we are just building a agent or agentic workflow not os. and our products can connect with tools used by human product managers through API s or MCP(model context protocol)s.
it also contain futures like coworking mode where is works with human partner and product must contain features like override and intercept. it must be best controllable product.

you are on the right path. now imagine we have a user Ui interface also to handle our product. it may web or desktop application. also remember net we are going to create other agents like designer,solution architect, software developer, tester agent, cloud agent. all are working together in a single platform for user to boost his productivity.
so our Product manager agent is a first agent we are developing. all other agents work is parallelly going. we will connect them all finally.

**hey i don't want to push you hard but how about using html css js like UI and backend python.**
also don't generate codes we need to design product first like what our product do what are the tools and integration we are going to add. who the architecture like things . don\t rush be step by step accurate product.
